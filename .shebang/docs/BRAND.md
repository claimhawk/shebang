## Brand Essence

### What We Are
An **automated development environment** that distills 60 years of hard-won programming wisdom into an intelligent agent that works alongside you.

### What We're Not
- A text editor with AI bolted on
- A chatbot that generates code
- A replacement for developers
- A product (we're public domain)

### The Core Insight
Programming knowledge has accumulated over six decades:
- Long hours over years and years
- A hundred books to find a few good pieces
- Teams of pragmatic programmers asking first-principles questions
- Mentorship chains stretching back decades
- Battle scars from production incidents at 3am

This isn't tribal knowledge or gatekeeping. It's **hard-fought, hard-won expertise**. And now it's distilled into the agent.

## Brand Values

### 1. Terminal as First-Class Citizen
The terminal is front and center — not hidden, not "for advanced users only." Everything flows through it because that's where real work happens. Transparency. Reproducibility. Power.

### 2. Hard-Won Wisdom, Available Instantly
We don't gatekeep. We don't require prerequisites. The agent has internalized decades of expertise so you don't have to start from zero.

### 3. The Interface Gets Out of Your Way
Natural language is the interface. No memorizing commands. No looking up flags. Just say what you want.

### 4. Agentic by Design
Built from the ground up for AI agents to operate alongside humans. Claude Code is a first-class citizen, not an afterthought.

### 5. Public Domain
No strings. No corporate BS. No gatekeeping. The Unlicense. Power to the people.

### 6. Built With Itself
Shebang! is built using Shebang! Not as a party trick, but as the ultimate dogfooding.

## Voice & Tone

### Personality
- **Real** — Authentic, not corporate
- **Direct** — Say what you mean
- **Confident** — We know what we're doing
- **Inclusive** — Everyone belongs here
- **Slightly irreverent** — Not afraid to break conventions

### Writing Style
- Short sentences. Punchy.
- Active voice, not passive
- "You" not "users" or "developers"
- Contractions are good
- Technical accuracy over buzzwords

### Examples

**Good:**
> Say "make the tests pass" and it figures out the rest.

**Bad:**
> Shebang! leverages cutting-edge AI to deliver transformative developer productivity.

**Good:**
> The terminal shows you what's happening. Claude Code talks to you in plain English.

## The Name Origin

`#!` (shebang) is the Unix mechanism that tells the system how to execute a script. Two characters at the top of every script that bridge human intent and machine execution.

That's exactly what Shebang! does: bridge "what I want" and "how it happens."
