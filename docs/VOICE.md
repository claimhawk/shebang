# Shebang Voice Guide

## The Vibe

Shebang documentation speaks in a **modern, authentic Gen Z voice** without being cringe or try-hard. We're talking real human energy, not corporate robot speak.

## Core Principles

### Be Real, Not Performative
- Say what you mean directly
- Skip the corporate fluff
- Don't oversell or hype
- Acknowledge when things are complicated

### Be Smart, Not Academic
- Explain complex things simply
- No unnecessary jargon
- When you must use technical terms, make them accessible
- Intelligence shows in clarity, not complexity

### Be Helpful, Not Condescending
- Assume the reader is smart
- Don't over-explain obvious things
- Respect their time
- Give them what they need to succeed

### Be Casual, Not Unprofessional
- Conversational tone, yes
- Contractions are your friend
- But still accurate and trustworthy
- Friendly expert, not your random buddy

## Voice Examples

### Instead of This (Corporate)

> "Shebang leverages cutting-edge artificial intelligence to deliver a transformative development experience that maximizes developer productivity through seamless integration of natural language processing capabilities."

### Write This

> "Shebang lets you just tell it what you want to do. No memorizing commands, no looking things up. Say 'make the tests pass' and it figures out the rest."

---

### Instead of This (Try-Hard Gen Z)

> "Shebang is literally bussin fr fr no cap! It slaps different and that's on periodt bestie! The vibes are immaculate and it's giving main character energy!"

### Write This

> "Look, traditional IDEs expect you to know everything already. That's wild. Shebang flips the script - you describe what you want, it handles the how."

---

### Instead of This (Academic)

> "The architectural paradigm employed by Shebang utilizes a reactive state management system wherein terminal output serves as the canonical source of truth, facilitating a unidirectional data flow pattern."

### Write This

> "Everything in Shebang flows through the terminal. Not because you need to read it, but because that's where the work actually happens. The terminal is truth."

## Tone Guidelines

### DO
- Use "you" and "your" - talk directly to the reader
- Use contractions (it's, you'll, don't)
- Use short sentences when making a point
- Use questions to engage ("Ever spent 20 minutes on a git rebase?")
- Be a little playful when appropriate
- Get to the point quickly

### DON'T
- Use slang that will age poorly (no "bussin", "fr fr", "no cap")
- Force memes or internet references
- Use excessive exclamation points
- Sound like a used car salesman
- Be sarcastic in a mean way
- Assume the reader is dumb

## Formatting Voice

### Headers
- Clear and direct
- Action-oriented when possible
- "Getting Started" not "Preliminary Configuration Procedures"

### Lists
- Parallel structure
- Start with verbs when it's instructions
- Keep items scannable

### Code Examples
- Minimal but sufficient
- Show the interesting part, not the boilerplate
- Include the "why" when it's not obvious

## The Bottom Line

Write like you're explaining something to a smart friend who hasn't used the tool before. Be the friend who actually knows what they're talking about but doesn't make you feel dumb for asking.
